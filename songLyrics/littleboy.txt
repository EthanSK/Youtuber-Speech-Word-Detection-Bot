Yoooo
You thought I forgot about you, little boy?
Yo, these niggas ain't ready
Yeah


Little boy tryna get involved
Come on, then, come on, then, let's get involved, you prick
Posh boy now wanna rap
Posh boy now wanna scrap
Posh boy bout to get clapped
By the end of the verse, you're gonna wish you never did that
Wish you never hit back, Guernseyâ€™s little boy's gonna feel it
When I get with the click click click clack
You ain't part of this group
You ain't Sidemen, you gook
Deciding when to be a Sideman
While you're too busy faking all the packs
And then making racks and spending all of that shit on
Now, Rosie a sket
And I know that you're listening beginning to sweat
Little boy not looking innocent all 'cause he wanna be relevant
Tatted my name on my body so you know I'm now in my element (I'm in my element)
Call me whatever you want, still looking up to me (fuck's sake!)
Sidemen the name of the group, all 'cause they needed the help from me
Yeah, bitch, I was the come-up
I'm the foundation for you to go run up
Keep playing FIFA, you ignorant fuck
Your girl is a gold digger, fuck
At least she knows how to suck (oh shit)
Wipe the floor when I deal with scrubs
Come at me, but I win in subs
I'm the giant, just killing bugs
You're just a shit ChrisMD
You need to get off MD
How many girls have you fucked in your life?
One, that's mad
Your girlfriend's forehead, mad
When you ask the sket to go give you head
Her reply is "Which one?" (ahh!)
Your dad is a weirdo (ayy)
He looks just like a pedo (ayy)
More inbred than yeast (ayy)
Your mum gets fucked by sheep (ayy)
Your sister fucks a crowbar (ayy)
Fam, it's really that deep (ayy!)
Sorry, nigga, but I said it (ayy)
Little boy, now regret it


Hahahahaha
You want to say that shit to me? Huh?
You want to say that shit to me?
Learn how to spell "renowned", you fucking idiot
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Not today, little boy
Ayy, ayy
